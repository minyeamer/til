## [과제] SQL 정형 데이터분석

### 1. 일주일 후 지속률을 계산하는 쿼리문을 작성하시오.(중 : 30점)

```sql
WITH
	action_log_with_mst_users AS
        (SELECT u.user_id
            , u.register_date
            , CAST(a.stamp AS DATE) AS action_date
            , MAX(CAST(a.stamp AS DATE)) OVER() AS latest_date
            , CAST(DATEADD(DD, 7, u.register_date) AS DATE) AS next_day_7
        FROM mst_users AS u
        LEFT OUTER JOIN action_log AS a
            ON u.user_id = a.user_id),
	user_action_flag AS (
        SELECT user_id
            , register_date
            , SIGN(SUM(CASE WHEN next_day_7 <= latest_date THEN
                        CASE WHEN next_day_7 = action_date THEN 1 ELSE 0 END
                END)) AS next_7_day_action
        FROM action_log_with_mst_users
        GROUP BY user_id, register_date)
SELECT register_date
    , AVG(100.0 * next_7_day_action) AS repeat_rate_7_day
FROM user_action_flag
GROUP BY register_date
ORDER BY register_date;
```

### 2. [강의안_6주차_2차시_코드2.sql]  파일의 쿼리문을 WITH문을 사용하지 않도록 변경하시오. (하 : 20점)

```sql
SELECT dt
	 , year_month
	 , amount AS total_amount
	 , (SELECT SUM(amount) FROM purchase_log_with_month AS s WHERE s.dt <= m.dt) AS agg_amount
FROM (SELECT dt
            , SUBSTRING(dt, 1, 7) AS year_month
            , SUM(purchase_amount) AS amount
    FROM purchase_log
    GROUP BY dt) AS m
ORDER BY dt;
```

### 3. 주어진 테이블을 이용하여 다음과 같은 실행 결과를 얻을 수 있는 쿼리문을 작성하시오. (상 : 50점)

```sql
SELECT `반`, COUNT(DISTINCT `이름`) AS '이름'
FROM `학생 테이블`
GROUP BY `반`;
```
